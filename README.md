# Simple_Guessing_Game_Python
A fun Python program where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

# Features

User sets the range (e.g., 1 to 100).

User sets the maximum attempts.

Computer generates a random secret number.

Player guesses until either:

They guess correctly → Win

They run out of attempts → Lose (secret number is revealed).

# Future Improvements

Add scoring system based on number of attempts.

Give hints (like "number is between 20–40").

Add replay option to play multiple rounds.
